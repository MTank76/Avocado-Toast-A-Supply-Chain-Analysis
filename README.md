## What’s in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis

### Project Overview

This project, conducted as part of a DataCamp course, provides a comprehensive supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in avocado toast. Utilizing data manipulation and analysis skills, we explore the extensive and intricate supply chain behind producing a seemingly simple dish. The project uses data from the Open Food Facts database, which offers detailed, open-source information on numerous food items, including their origins and supply chain details.

### Objectives

- **Analyze the Supply Chain**: Understand the complex pathways that each ingredient of avocado toast takes from farm to table.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilize various data manipulation techniques to extract and clean relevant information from the Open Food Facts database.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations that effectively communicate the journey of each ingredient.
- **Sustainability Insights**: Provide insights into the environmental impact and sustainability of the supply chain.

### Methodology

1. **Data Extraction**: Data is sourced from the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database, which contains detailed information on food products worldwide.
2. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, the data is cleaned, formatted, and manipulated to facilitate analysis.
3. **Supply Chain Mapping**: Each ingredient’s supply chain is mapped out, showcasing the various stages of production, processing, and transportation.
4. **Visualization**: Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are used to create insightful visualizations that depict the supply chain processes and highlight critical aspects such as transportation distances and carbon footprints.
5. **Sustainability Analysis**: An evaluation of the sustainability of each ingredient’s supply chain, including environmental impacts and potential areas for improvement.
